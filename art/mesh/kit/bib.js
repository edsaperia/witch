// A part of the kit a mesh creature's plan is put together from (art/mesh/species/<id>.js; the how-to is in docs/notes/creatures.md,
// **Writing a mesh creature**). One part a file, so two batches adding parts don't touch the same lines: a new part is a new file
// here, imported by the species that use it. Each part returns { bones, lofts, cones } pieces (metres; y up; its head along +z);
// plan.js joins them. The shapes start from a red fox's, measured; a species bends them to its own animal.
