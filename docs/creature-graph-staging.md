# Creature graph staging

Authorised by Ed on 2026-10-30, routed through issue #1453. Experimental only;
the production builders, genomes, baked assets and live rig keep their defaults.

## Ownership

This branch owns `art/body-graph/`, `tools/body-graph/`,
`src/bodyGraph.test.ts` and this staging note. Changes to shared rendering,
asset workers or existing species require a coordinator answer first.

## Stages

1. Audit the current builder dispatch and provide a graph with spine stations,
   typed sockets and tapered limb families using the existing Model skin blend.
   Add diagnostic fixtures and geometry checks without a production import.
2. Review representative animal comparisons and agree acceptance with the
   coordinator: proposed bear (flat feet), wolf (raised heels), stag (hooves),
   then bat, snail and hydra to challenge the graph beyond four-legged bodies.
3. Add a gait clock and IK with contact, reach and loop invariants; review sprite
   strips before connecting the graph to the bake or live rig.
4. Migrate species only after explicit acceptance. Keep cache invalidation and
   default switching a separate reviewed step.

## Audit observations

The backlog's builder counts are historical, not a current inventory. The
templates already carry socket tags, size curves and gait timings. `Model`
already provides smooth unions between primitives in the same group and
tapered rounded segments (`seg`, `chain`). Its `field` measures a hard union;
`groupField` measures the blended surface. Diagnostics must use the latter
when checking skin joins. No external asset or dependency is required.

## Deferred work and trigger

Species replacement, production bake integration and live-rig changes wait
until the coordinator posts representative fixtures and visual acceptance on
this branch's PR. Stage 1 is an engine diagnostic, not animal art parity or a
completed unified generator.
